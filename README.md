### AWS (Amazon Web Services) - launch a virtual machine
- ![diagram](AWS_workflow.png?raw=true "AWS_with_ssh")
- ensure file.pem is read-only `chmod 400 file.pem` and also located in .ssh directory 
- visit Amazon's Global Infrastructure
  - https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/?nc2=type_a
  - sign in to the console or create account
  - under 'services' choose `EC2`
  - `launch instances`
  - `select` virtual machine with appropriate specs
    - Eng110 is using Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS(HVM) 64-bit (x86)
  - choose an instance type (virtual servers with varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity)
    - Eng110 is using `t2.micro`
  - bottom of screen click button `Next: Configure Instance Details`
    - choose number of instances
    - choose Network (Eng110 is using default)
    - choose Subnet (Eng110 is using Default in eu-west-1a)
    - Auto-assign Public IP `Enable`
    - Hostname type: Use subnet setting(IP name)
    - DNS Hostname: check box `Enable resource-based IPv4 (A record) DNS requests`
  - bottom of screen click button `Next: Add Storage`
  - Eng110 is using default storage device -> bottom of screen click button `Next: Add Tags`
  - `Add Tag`: key => `Name` value => `eng110_bens`
  - bottom of screen click button `Next: Configure Security Group`
  - either create a new security group or select an existing security group
    - if creating new:
      - follow naming conventions 
        - Security Group Name: `eng110_bens_sg_app`
        - Description: `eng110_bens_sg_app` or `eng110_bens_sg_app - Ben - Jack - Nikhil are only to use` for example
      - Type `SSH` we need for installations
      - Protocol `TCP`
      - Port Range `22` (SSH port)
      - Source `My IP` (Nobody else should be able to access our EC2 instances)
      - Description example `office ip - my ip`
      - click button `Add Rule` to configure for nginx
        - Type `HTTP`
        - Protocol `TCP`
        - Port Range `80`
        - Source `Anywhere`
        - Description example `for nginx - public access`
  - bottom of screen click button `Review and Launch`
    - this gives us an opportunity to view all the details before we purchase
      - click button `launch`
        - now we need to let AWS know that we want to launch this instance and we want to access using whichever key
          - create new key pair or select existing key pair
            - select from dropdown menu (eng110 is using `eng119 | RSA`)
          - click button `View Instances`
  - select checkbox for instance to display its information below
    - copy Public IPv4 address
    - click button `Connect`
  - We are using SSH client
    - copy example ssh code below for gitbash command to access
    - open an SSH client (gitbash) as admin
  - In gitbash navigate to .ssh directory and ensure the filename.pem key file is inside 
  - paste previously copied ssh code as gitbash command => (example): `ssh -i "eng119.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-195-173-115.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com` 
  - Now we've successfully landed on AWS
    - Does it have internet? `sudo apt-get update -y`
    - Upgrade: `sudo apt-get upgrade -y`
    - Install nginx: `sudo apt install nginx -y`
  - Once installed go back to 'Connect to instance' AWS page and select `EC2 Instance Connect` tab
    - copy Public IP address and paste into url bar of browser for access
